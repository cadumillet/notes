# Notes
These are my notes to help me keep things organized. It's not my goal here to dive in some technical topics, for that, I prefer to build simple projects when I can pratice some languages, concepts and technologies.

## Checklists and Reminders

- [ ] Set up the environment: install packages, init, configure files, dev dependencies
- [ ] Think about conventions: directory structure, file and folders names
- [ ] Ask the ins and outs: make it work in a simple way

## Roadmap
Almost every day I learn about something new, so I thought that it would be nice to know where to use this technology.

### Environment
- Languages and frameworks: Javascript, React, Node, Next.JS, TypeScript
- Database: MongoDB (Atlas, Compass, Mongo Shell)
- HTTP: Axios, JQueryAJAX, FetchAPI

- Tools: Superplate, Strapi

### Build
Think about the structure, some technologies and repositories.

- Components Libraries: Bootstrap, MUI, Tailwind
- Forms and validation: Formik, Yup, React Hook Form
- Captcha: GeeTest
- Version Control Systems: Github

### Test

- Runtime: Jest, Cypress, Jasmine
- Analysis: ESlint
- Formatter: Prettier

### Deployment

- CircleCI
