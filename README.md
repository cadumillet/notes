# Notes
These are my notes to help me keep things organized. It's not my goal here to dive in some technical topics, for that, I prefer to build simple projects when I can pratice some languages, concepts and technologies.

## Checklists and Reminders

- [ ] Set up the environment: install packages, init, configure files, dev dependencies
- [ ] Think about conventions: directory structure, file and folders names
- [ ] Ask the ins and outs: make it work in a simple way
